Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The moment I decided I would be Computer Scientist happened fairly late in my life - my freshmen year at college. Despite not being a CS major at the time, several classes had me use languages like Python and MATLAB on projects and assignments. What seemed like an inconvinece at the time would turn into a huge facination that literally changed the trajectory of my life. 

It didn't take long after to switch and dive into this whole new world. Like most other programmers, I simply find the problem solving nature and methodology of programming very captivating. As I countine learning, I look foward mostly to practicing event driven programming and making projects of my own interest.

Proffiecent at: Python, C, C++
Learning: Java, SQL, F#
