Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The moment I decided I would be Computer Scientist happened fairly late in my life - my freshmen year at college. Despite not being a CS major at the time, several classes had me use languages like Python and MATLAB on projects and assignments. What seemed like an inconvinece at the time would turn into a huge facination that literally changed the trajectory of my life.

Proffiecent at: Python, C, C++
